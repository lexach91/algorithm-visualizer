# Path-finding algorithms visualizer
[Path-finding algorithms visualizer](https://python-algorithm-visualizer.herokuapp.com/) is a python terminal application that allows the user to understand how the path-finding algorithms work by visualizing them in the terminal.

User can generate different types of patterns and mazes on the provided grid, place the start and end points, and then run the algorithms to find the shortest path between them.

- When the page is loaded, click the "RUN PROGRAM" button.
- Navigate through the menu options using the arrow keys on your keyboard, press enter to choose an option.
- First, you will need to choose the type of pattern you want to generate in the "Grid options".
- Then, you will need to place the start and end points on the grid in the "Place start and end node".
- Finally, you will need to choose which algorithm you want to run in "Pathfinder algorithms".
